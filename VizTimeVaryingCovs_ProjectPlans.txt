PRIMARY GOAL: 
	demo that can upload data and plot survival probability for time-varying covariates 
	(can require binary only, can require specific trajectories)

SECONDARY GOALS: 
	(1) user-specified trajectories
	(2) prettier plot: user-specify elements (labels, legend, colors, etc.)
	(3) option to show (invalid) use of time-varying covariate as baseline covariate
	(4) arbitrary data names

TERTIARY GOALS:
	(1) non-martingale representation for input data (or martingale expression, if that is the original)
	(2) arbitrary class of time-varying covariate 
	



ROLES:
	presenter
	UI/front end
	back end
	good data examples
